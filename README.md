# magic_bullet
.zsh script to auto set up barebones express and sinatra files

N.B this is a first pass at this script - the basic functionality is there but please note it is work in progress. Any suggestions for additions are also welcome!

Instructions for Use:

N.B. .the below instructions are designed for use with Sublime Text Editor. If you have a different editor please consider when doing step 1.

1. Go to Terminal and execute following command : sublime ~/.zshrc
2. Copy the two long lines of code from the magic_bullet.txt file
3. At the bottom of .zshrc file paste the two copied lines and save.
4. In Terminal run source ~/.zshrc  to update zsh
5. Create a folder for your new app and cd into it
6. Type either "ratpack!" (for Ruby Sinatra) or "runforrest!" (for express javascript) and go get yourself a coffee - you've just saved 5 mins of tedious setup.
